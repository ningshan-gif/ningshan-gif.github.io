Today I spent a good amount of time thinking, perhaps i do believe in reincarnation and past lives. So many cultures and religions have some form of 轮回，转世，reincarnation / samsara / long-living eternity, even in sicence there’s some hypothesis of parallel universe and non-linearity of time, (we still have no idea about what time is). to me, it’s more than a grand promise given to alleviate the fear of death. I think I would be ok knowing that there would be no more whatsoever after death, just the disassembly of the particles that make up me (and the graduallyg approaching 0 probability that they would ever make up me again). but for my current life, I’ll rather think it is some string that has carried me here (in Chinese it’s called 缘), I’d rather think I’m here / I’m brought to life and this particular life because of something or someone I’m searching for, something I need to do, that my past lives or something have somehow informed even before I was born. I still don’t know what that thing is, or who that person is, and sometimes I wonder if any resonant memories or destiny of my past life could have come up in anyway. I genuinely hope that samara / reincarnation exists, and that I’m tied to the people and the world around me by an invisible force, and especially a special person whom I delineate as my love, probably across many universes and many lifetimes, that would draw me inevitably to this encounter, and would continue into my next life too.
