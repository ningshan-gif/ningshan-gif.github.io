Fall 2021: I built a robot using Arduino, color sensor and PID control My robot won 1st place in the NEET Autonomous Machines competition. The challenge is the navigate through a maze with black lines successfully and accurately despite corners and intersections minimizing total time. 

Here's a demo of the robot working on a smaller scale board.
